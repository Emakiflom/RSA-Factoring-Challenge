# RSA Factoring Challenge

## Overview

This project involves factorizing numbers into a product of two smaller numbers. It includes two tasks - one for general factorization and another for the RSA factoring challenge. The RSA factoring challenge focuses on finding two prime numbers given an RSA number.

## Task 0: Factorize all the things!

Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

### Usage

```bash
./factors <file>


./factors tests/test00
